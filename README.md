This repository contains simulation and analysis code for the project "Improving Resolution of Dynamic Communities in Human Brain Networks through Targeted Node Removal"

The main files in the repository include:

~ mini_fig.m : prototype of small network schematic (Figs. 1 and 2)

~ kuramoto_examples.m : example code for running kuramoto simulations and saving results

~ kuramoto_statplots.m : script to create figures and test hypotheses from saved kuramoto oscillator examples (Figs. 3-5)

~ brain_cd_analysis.m : script to compare brain network flexibility before and after removal of visual cortex (Figs. 6, 7, and 9)

~ power_region_analysis.m : script for computing differences in brain functional system recruitment before and after removal of visual cortex (Figs. 8 and S1)

Other files include:

~ directories of utility functions for community detection (CD_Utils/), running kuramoto simulations (Kuramoto/), plotting and statistical analysis (Analysis_Utils/), brain region labeling (Region_Info/), and basic MATLAB functionality (MATLAB_Utils/)
